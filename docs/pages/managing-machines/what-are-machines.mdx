When using a [Machine Provider](../managing-providers/what-are-providers.mdx),
providers will use VMs to run your workspace.  
These VMs are the Machines managed by DevPod during the creation/deletion of a
worskapce.

If you want, you can directly manage all the machines in the various workspaces using:

```sh
devpod machine
```
