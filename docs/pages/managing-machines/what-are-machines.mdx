When using a [Machine Provider](../managing-providers/what-are-providers.mdx), providers will use machines (in the cloud provider case VMs) to host your workspace.
These VMs are the Machines managed by DevPod during the creation/deletion of a workspace.

If you want, you can directly manage all the machines in the various workspaces using:

```sh
devpod machine
```
