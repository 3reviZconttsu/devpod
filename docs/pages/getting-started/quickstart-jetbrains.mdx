A new window appears showing DevPod starting the workspace. After the workspace was created, JetBrains Gateway should automatically open with a prefilled form for the workspace.

Press 'Check Connection and Continue' without changing any configuration. This should start the IDE in the workspace. After the IDE has been initialized, your JetBrains IDE should open up inside the workspace.
