title: Provider Binaries
sidebar_label: Provider Binaries
---

The `binaries` section, is dedicated for providers that work using a custom built
program.

An example of this type of provider are:

- [devpod-provider-aws](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod-provider-aws/releases)
- [devpod-provider-azure](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod-provider-azure/releases)
- [devpod-provider-civo](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod-provider-civo/releases)
- [devpod-provider-digitalocean](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod-provider-digitalocean/releases)
- [devpod-provider-gcloud](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod-provider-gcloud/releases)

These providers will handle all the phases of the VM's lifecycle, using the
specific cloud's APIs.

Being a program that runs on your machine and that can potentially handle sensitive
data (like passwords and tokens) DevPod has a dedicated section to handle binary's
verification and retrieval.

Each binary is declared as:

```yaml
binaries:
  NAME:
    - os: # Which OS is this specific binary
      arch: # Binary arch
      path: # Remote (URL) or local path to binary
      checksum:  # sha sum of the binary
```

When [Adding a provider](../managing-providers/add-provider.mdx), DevPod will
match the binary for your OS and Arch and download the specific one for it.

Example of the binary section in a `provider.yaml`:

```yaml
binaries:
  AWS_PROVIDER:
    - os: linux
      arch: amd64
      path: https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod-provider-aws/releases/download/v0.0.1-alpha.15/devpod-provider-aws-linux-amd64
      checksum: d1e774419d90c3ed399963d9322d57bfdcee189767eabb076a2c2e926bfd9b8b
    - os: linux
      arch: arm64
      path: https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod-provider-aws/releases/download/v0.0.1-alpha.15/devpod-provider-aws-linux-arm64
      checksum: fa15c13e3f0619170d002f9dae3ef41c9949a4595a71c5efe364d89ada604cec
    - os: darwin
      arch: amd64
      path: https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod-provider-aws/releases/download/v0.0.1-alpha.15/devpod-provider-aws-darwin-amd64
      checksum: fb89d41f6ce3e01e953f3ffd18f85bd5a42dd633abafd5d586dc9d9b1322166c

    - os: windows
      arch: amd64
      path: https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod-provider-aws/releases/download/v0.0.1-alpha.15/devpod-provider-aws-windows-amd64.exe
      checksum: 49bd899d439f38d4e8647102db1c18b7a0d5242b3c09c89071b20a5444e20a81
```

### Binary Checksum

Each binary is also verified over an expected checksum. This is important to
ensure that whatever binary is declared in `provider.yaml` is indeed executed on
the machine.

## Use binaries in commands

Each binary declared, will be available as command using the name as variable.

For example:

```yaml
binaries:
  MY_BINARY:
    ....

exec:
  init: ${MY_BINARY} init
  ....
```

:::info
This variable will be available across the whole manifest.
