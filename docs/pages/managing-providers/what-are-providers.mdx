Providers are simple programs that let DevPod build, manage and run the environments
requested by the user.

DevPod relies on a model of providers in order to ensure great flexibility and
easy adaptability for any backend of choice.

See the [Add a provider](.//add-provider.mdx) section to know
more on how to handle them.

## Type of providers

There are two type of providers possible:

* Machine providers
* Non-machine providers

### Machine providers

Machine providers are those who will create and manage a VM for the workspace
selected.

An example of Machine provider is the AWS Provider, which uses EC2 instances to
run the environment.

These type of providers will also manage the lifecycle of the VM, starting/stopping
and deleting it when needed.

### Non-Machine providers

Non-machine providers are those who will work directly with containers, instead
of using VMs.

An example of this can be the SSH, Kubernetes and Docker providers.

Those providers will **not** create a VM, but directly run the environment's
containers on the target.
