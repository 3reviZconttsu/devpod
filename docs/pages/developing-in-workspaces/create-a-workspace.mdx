## Create a Workspace

You can create a workspace either from the DevPod CLI or through the desktop application. A workspace can be created from a git repository, a local path or a docker container (e.g. `golang:latest`).

Upon successful creation, DevPod will make the development container available at the ssh host `WORKSPACE.devpod`. Alternatively, DevPod can automatically open the workspace in a locally installed IDE, such as VSCode or Intellij.

:::info
A workspace is defined through a `devcontainer.json`. If DevPod can't find one, it will automatically try to guess the programming language of your project and provide a fitting template.
:::

### Via DevPod Desktop Application

Navigate to the 'Workspaces' view and click on the 'Create' button in the title. Enter the git repository you want to work on or select a local folder.

You can also configure one of the additional settings:
- **Provider**: The provider to use for this workspace
- **Default IDE**: The ide to open after successfully creating this workspace
- **Workspace Name**: Override the automatically determined workspace name with this option
- **Prebuild Repository**: A docker image repository such as `ghcr.io/my-org/my-repo` that contains prebuilds for this workspace. DevPod will try to automatically find a fitting prebuild for this workspace in the given repository.

Then press `Create Workspace` to launch the workspace.

:::info
Under the hood, the Desktop Application will call a `devpod up REPOSITORY`
:::

### Via DevPod CLI

Make sure to install the DevPod cli locally and select a provider you would like to host the workspace on (such as local docker).

#### Git Repository

Run the following command in a terminal to start a new workspace:

```
# Create from git repository
devpod up github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-node
```

:::info Private Git Repositories
DevPod will forward git credentials to a remote machine so that you can also pull private repositories.
:::


:::info Multiple workspaces from the same repository
Use the `--id` flag to override the name of the workspace. This allows you to create multiple workspaces from the same repository.
:::


#### Local Path

Run the following command in a terminal to create a new workspace:

```
# Create from a local path
devpod up ./path/to/my-folder
```

DevPod will sync the folder into the remote machine and create a development environment out of the `devcontainer.json`.

#### Docker Image

Run the following command in a terminal to create a new workspace from a docker image:

```
# Create from a docker image
devpod up ghcr.io/my-org/my-repo:latest
```

DevPod will create the following `devcontainer.json` for this:
```
{
    "image": "ghcr.io/my-org/my-repo:latest"
}
```

## Recreating a workspace

If you are working on the `devcontainer.json` or have pulled changes that affect the development environment, you can recreate a workspace. Recreating a workspace means to apply changes in the `devcontainer.json` or related `Dockerfile` to the development environment. If a prebuild repository is supplied, DevPod will try to find the updated development environment image inside the prebuild repository and if not found, will fallback to building it.

When recreating a workspace, changes only to the project path or mounted volumes will be preserved. **All other changes made in the container will be lost.**

### Via DevPod Desktop Application

Navigate to the 'Workspaces' view and press on the 'More Options' button on the workspace you want to recreate. Then press 'Rebuild' and confirm the form to rebuild the workspace.

### Via DevPod CLI

Run the following command to rebuild an existing workspace:
```
devpod up my-workspace --recreate
```
