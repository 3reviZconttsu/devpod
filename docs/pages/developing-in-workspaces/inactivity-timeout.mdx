As a form of cost control DevPod will keep track of all the Workspace running on a
provider's machine.
If no Workspaces are running on a machine after a set period of time, DevPod will
proceed to shut-down the machine, in order to preserve costs.

Machines stopped this way preserve the data and state, so when a workspace [is started again](./connect-to-a-workspace.mdx),
DevPod will simply restart the machine and the workspace.

:::info
All official DevPod providers offer this pre-configured to 10 minutes.

## Configuring the timeout

Changing the default setting for inactivity timeout can be done [configuring the provider](../managing-providers/add-provider.mdx#set-provider-options).

:::info
More info about the provider's auto-shutdown can be found in the [agent's development guide](../developing-providers/agent.mdx#machine-providers)
That will explain how this is done and what can be configured.
