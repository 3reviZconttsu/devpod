- **8,500+ architectural components**: You can access a library of over 8,500 intelligent architectural components, such as doors, windows, stairs, roofs, walls, and furniture. These components have real-world behavior and construction, and can be customized to suit your needs. You can also create your own components by modifying existing ones or using predefined layer standards[^1^].
- **Automatic object generation**: You can save time and increase productivity by automatically generating commonly used architectural objects, such as floor plans, elevations, sections, and ceiling grids. You can also create schedules, legends, and tags based on the data in your drawings[^1^].
- **Drawing version management**: You can check out and check in files to maintain versioning, prevent unauthorized modifications, and ensure drawing integrity. You can also easily revert to an earlier version of your drawing with comments history, and view the drawing name appended with check-in time[^1^].
- **Display system**: You can control how your objects appear in different types of drawings, view directions, and levels of detail. With the display system, you only have to draw an architectural object once, and it will change automatically to meet the display requirements of various drawings[^1^].
- **Designing with space and zone objects**: You can enhance your design options by using space and zone objects. Spaces are areas defined by boundaries that can contain data such as area, volume, occupancy, etc. Zones are groups of spaces that can be structured according to different schemes, such as fire protection, HVAC, lighting, etc. You can use spaces and zones to organize reports and analyze your design[^1^].
- **Detail component manager**: You can use the detail component manager dialog box to seamlessly navigate between different detail component databases. A hierarchical tree view and a filter feature make it easy to locate individual components within a database. You can also create your own detail components or import them from other sources[^1^].
- **Architectural renovation**: You can display existing, demolished, and new construction in a single drawing. This lets you design and produce renovations more quickly, while avoiding errors typically caused by editing multiple drawings. You can also use renovation filters to control the visibility of different construction phases[^1^].

These are just some of the features of AutoCAD Architecture 2011 64 bit that make it a powerful and efficient software for architectural design. If you want to learn more about this software, you can visit the official website[^2^], read the online help[^3^], or check out some books on this topic.
